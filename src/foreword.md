# Foreword

---

I care not for the wealth of golden Gyges, nor ever have envied him;

I am not jealous of the works of Gods, and I have no desire for lofty despotism;

for such things are far beyond my ken.

*Archilocus*

## Warning
> This manifesto can be said naive because of its optimism.\
\
Expect the unexpected, which can go awfully wrong.\
New paradigms tend to replicate past patterns.\
This text has chosen to ignore them.\
\
Underlying principles of a wishful future keep us on track.

## Impetus
When the world is getting lost in details;\
focus on what matters within those details.

1. Principles give a strategy;
2. patterns are tactical.
3. Derive technology;
4. build it,
5. for action.
6. Debug and analyze.
7. Repeat.

## Laws

Let
- in a unique tripartite ecosystem, a protocol regulate a public utility;
- among affected parties, agents be groups of actors.

*The Ruled Power has shown.*

1. The inner protocol copies communication structures between agents.[^n]

2. The outer protocol bounds the inner protocol in an ecosystem.[^o]

3. Tokenomic Doer macromanages with Law Programming Interfaces (LPI).\
3'. Economic Maker micromanages with legislation.[^o]

4. In the Tokenomy, Doer manages the protocol; Maker legislates utility.\
4'. In the Economy, Maker legislates the protocol; Doer manages utility.[^o]

5. A paradigmatic justice mechanism balances doer and maker powers.[^t]

6. Undirected communication edges transpose into price systems.[^e]

7. Directed communication edges transpose into data feeds.[^s]

*Notes*

[^n] By virtue of Conway's law;\
communication graphs of Maker knowledge organize inner systems of rules.

[^o] By virtue of Tripartite Ecosystems, centralized and decentralized.\

[^t] By virtue of Montesquieu's political triad;\
the user power is preserved in a judiciary as well as in a trading system.

[^e] By virtue of Hayek's 1945 paper;\
price systems synthesize communication to coordinate independent actors.

[^s] By virtue of IT systems.

|---------------------|----------------|---------|----------|
| Tokenomy | currency | DLT | crypto |
| Economy | currency | central bank | fiat |

A protocol inherits the features of management.

### Systemic Resilience

*a. breaking the business mold*

Tokenomics gives a new chance to ostracized business models;\
which didn't fit well within a corporate or individual framework.\
We will all benefit.\
Business standardization of national administrations templatized success.\
It also made failure a generic feature with no addressable cause.\
Lost entrepreneurship has made us more prone to systemic crises.\
The breakdown of conformity produces seismic ripple effects.\
This awareness makes lawmakers highly conservative.\
Compliance imposes a narrow scope.\
It is so tight that innovation bubbles skyrocket whenever an escape looms.\
Speculative frenzy gives our Economy a spring break.\
The derived effectiveness of strict laws comes at a high opportunity cost.\
Co-creation, ecosystem services, micro-contributions, local economies;\
and countless worthwhile activities in the public domain lack facilities.\
They'd be criminals, should they tokenize lightweight currencies to exist.\
They have not yet found the marketplace to become sustainable;\
or weight against an arbitrary financial scale.\
Horizontal accessibility is a process of decentralization.\
This process will bring a diversity of rules and opinions.\
For a more resilient future, they will be eager to invest in alternatives.\
A myriad of arrangements widens financial commitment to public utility.\
Exclusive utility will remain in the private domain.\
Privileges have no price unless given up.\
We will buy them out.\
Eventually, central governance will recognize the need for specialization.\
Governments will offer institutional composability to attract businesses.\
Law Programming Interfaces (LPI) will provide a lean frame of free rules.\
Open public contracts backed by the judiciary will rule inadequacy out.

### Self-directed Inclusion

*b. consensual will*

Hayek poses that self-interested agents manage priced resources:
> prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of different people in the same way as subjective values help the individual to coordinate the parts of his plan

Empathy is a nice-to-have but it's not part of the equation.\
Unilateral altruism can ease but cannot sustain.\
Ethics is a matter of aesthetics.\
It offers no guarantee.\
Fashion changes with seasons and forced change offers resistance.\
Should we hammer harder on a tough nail?\
We might break something.\
Elasticity is not built-in;\
but built-out through an extension of opportunities.\
Redistribution cannot scale to a billion people with incompatible beliefs.\
They are increasingly aware that decisions have far-reaching consequences.\
No one will agree.\
We need multilateral rather than authoritative solutions.\
Subjectivity accumulates in tokenized public utility.\
We need inclusive markets of what matters.

### Cultural Breakout

*c. heads or tails*

Culture precedes change.\
Society is on the verge of becoming more inclusive.\
Cyberspace has propelled new ideas beyond confined territories;\
freed collectives from physical and knowledge barriers;\
exposed and debated toxic disrespect;\
took self-expression and creativity to new levels;\
celebrated subcultures;\
created unknown celebrities;\
and regrouped myriads of communities.\
Social accounts have all the same rights;\
and intellectual property has become counterproductive in Web3.\
We're now knowledge and remote workers, open source contributors;\
or simply digital friends.\
On the flip side of the coin, means of biased control have grown.\
Like means of freedom, they have propagated exponentially.\
Usable users eat cookies in innocent web parties.\
Fear not, for servers without a master are with you.\
Soon enough, peer nodes will outnumber database slaves.

### The End

*d. fanciful sunrise*

One-to-one architecture will pave the way for Pareto efficiency.\
Every deal will make two winners and zero loser.\
Flat organizations will free the sky from high-rises.\
Previously short-sighted, bums will see the horizon from the sidewalk.\
Information will crystallize from Hayek's foresight:\
*the particular circumstances of time and place*.\
Knowledge already self-executes from the source of truth:\
an online and collaborative base.\
Artificial intelligence will be vetted by countless human beings.\
With barely any computing power, they compose greater singularities:\
than that of science because they are engineered to deliver;\
than that of machine learning because they are democratic;\
than that of sci-fi because they are real.\
Anyone;\
everyone;\
will discern their own fantasy in connected valleys and mountain ranges.\
The incredible price consensus is reached across continents.\
Billions of people who don't know each other take part and negotiate.\
Price forms in unpredictable interactions, regulations and manipulations.\
We rarely contest a price on the condition to take it or leave it.\
But we do know it's largely been manufactured by a random agency.\
We deeply understand that subsystems can be improved.\
Even so-called free markets have been marketed and designed.\
Emergence of self-enforcing protocols will take us to the 22nd century.\
We will assist throughout the 21st to a tokenization wave;\
which we never dared to think of.\
Microscopic price systems will flood the ocean.\
Whales will go on a healthy diet.\
Decentralized markets will distribute value for values.\
Most burning desires and greatest hopes will unite to buy out our fears.

**It is high time we took Tokenomics seriously.**
